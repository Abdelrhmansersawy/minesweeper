This project consists of a **Minesweeper AI** that plays the Minesweeper game autonomously. The AI uses logic to deduce the locations of mines and systematically reveal safe cells. Here’s an overview of the key components:

### Key Features

- **AI Agent**: The AI is programmed to make decisions based on the number of neighboring mines and progressively reveal cells while marking suspected mines.
- **Graphical Interface**: Displays the game board and visualizes the AI’s progress in solving the Minesweeper puzzle.
- **Customizable Assets**: Fonts and images can be modified in the `assets` folder to adjust the game's appearance.

Make sure you have Python installed. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Game with AI
